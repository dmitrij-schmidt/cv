<section id="#education">
    <h1>Education</h1>
    <p>My formal education was as far from IT as one can imagine (European Studies and Public Diplomacy). That had to be fixed,
        and it was by attending two certified bootcamps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>CodersLab Front-End</b> - mainly JS/HTML/CSS with some bits of GIT and jQuery. This course made me believe, that
            I can earn my own bread being a dev.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Od zera do WebDeva</b> - concentrated on PHP (with Laravel as a framework of choice) and Vue.js</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the meantime, I "received" some informal, and hard to proove education from discussion boards (e.g. Quora, StackOverflow),
        online courses (edX, Laracasts, Coursera, Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, just to name a few) and of course problem solving
        during daily tasks.</p>
</section>
<section id="experience">
    <h1>Experience &amp; skills</h1>
    <p>My current level of experience can be described as not-so-junior fullstack developer. At the moment of last update I
        have have finished two educational (student management) projects for one of the polish universities. Their code,
        or front-end parts cannot be shared, since they are NDA-protected, and login restricted.
        <br> In the course of my short career I have been working with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>HTML/CSS</b> - I am well aware of changes in semantics brought by HTML5. I know how to use Flexbox and Grid and
            why they are different. I know enough of front-end development to use Normalize.css, and check my code in different
            browsers. I know that "mobile first" is trending, that Bootstrap, Bulma, Vuetify etc. are awesome, and that customizing
            them can be a nightmare.</li>
        <li>
            <b>PHP/JS</b> - along with their frameworks Laravel/Vue.js, and "ye olde jQuery". I have some experience with REST
            APIs, AJAX requests (using jQuery and axios, less with vanilla JS), JSON format responses.</li>
        <li>
            <b>SQL</b> and MySQL as a database. I am aware of different data types, field types, relations, basic SQL queries,
            and not to click a "DROP" button.</li>
        <li>
            <b>GIT</b> - creating/cloning repo, committing/pushing/pulling changes, basic branching.</li>
    </ul>
